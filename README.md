## 📖 The Story Behind the Challenge
I recently successfully wrapped up my latest professional project. While I am currently in a transition phase, evaluating new exciting opportunities and deciding where to bring my value next, I refused to stay idle. 

Instead of just waiting, I’ve decided to turn this "gap" into a high-performance training camp. This challenge is my way of staying sharp, testing my limits, and building a public portfolio of what I can deliver in record time.

## 🎯 The Goal
Building **2 functional applications every single day** for 10 consecutive days. 
* **Focus:** Speed, Architectural Clarity, and Fullstack integration.
* **Stack:** Java/Spring Boot for the heavy lifting, Angular for the slick interfaces.
* **The Human Factor:** This challenge is tackled **without AI assistance** (or strictly limited to boilerplate/debugging), prioritizing raw coding skill and mental agility over generated code.
