## 📖 The Story Behind the Challenge
I recently wrapped up my latest professional projects. While I have some days off. I refused to stay idle.

Instead, I’m turning this gap into a high-performance sprint. It’s a challenge to stay sharp and level up my skills, ensuring I return to my professional role with even stronger capabilities and a proven track record of rapid, clean delivery.

I also want this to be a shared space. Any developer is welcome to collaborate, suggest improvements, or join the challenge. I have detailed how you can participate below.

## 🎯 The Goal
Building **2 functional applications every single day** for 10 consecutive days. 
* **Focus:** Speed, Architectural Clarity, and Fullstack integration.
* **Stack:** Java/Spring Boot for the heavy lifting, Angular for the slick interfaces.
* **The Human Factor:** This challenge is tackled **without AI assistance** (or strictly limited to boilerplate/debugging), prioritizing raw coding skill and mental agility over generated code.
